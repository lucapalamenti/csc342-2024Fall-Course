## Guidelines for screencasts

* Make sure your audio is working. Screencasts must include video and narration.
* Mention your name, Unity Id, and the assignment you will be describing/demoing when you begin.
* Editing is not required, but is allowed. Be creative!
* Follow the specific content guidelines in each assignment


## General Advice

* Keep the screencast short and focused
* Use clear and concise language to explain the code and the results
* Write a script and rehearse it, but don't read off the script when recording.
* Know your audience and what you want to communicate.
* Speak clearly and enunciate. Make sure you have good sound quality.
* Trim unnecessary content. For example, cut out the installation of NPM modules or other long pauses.
* Test the screencast before submission to make sure it is working properly and that the audio and video are clear and synchronized.
