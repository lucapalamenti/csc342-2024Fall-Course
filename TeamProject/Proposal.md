# Group Project: Project Proposal

For this milestone of your project, you will briefly present your project idea for a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that addresses a real-world problem or need.

**The assignment is due Friday, September 27th, before midnight.**

## Part 1: Group Repository Setup

We have created a GitHub repository that you and your teammates will share for your group project. You will use this repository to submit your project code artifacts and some documentation. Your team repository's URL will have the following form:

```
https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc342/csc342-2024Fall-Team{LETTER}
```

Make sure every member of your team has access to this repository.

You will need to update the `README.md` file on the root of your team repository replacing the placeholders with your team details.

Additionally, each of you should update your individual portfolio repositories in the main `README.md` file to have a link to your group project repository.

## Part 2: The Proposal

Your task for this milestone is to identify and describe an interesting challenge for which a Progressive Web Application (PWA) would be an appropriate solution. You will then write a brief project proposal that contains:

* A title for your project.
* The problem or need that your proposed PWA addresses. Who are the target users, and why would they want to use your app?
* The general features your application provides. What are the things users will be able to accomplish with your app? What data do you need for this to work, and how will you get it?
* How do you plan to take advantage of PWA capabilities? What are the main features of your app that will be enhanced by being a PWA? In other words, why is a PWA a good fit to address the problem or need you identified?
* Include supporting draft wireframes of the main views illustrating how you envision your application will work. Remember that PWAs are mobile-first, so your wireframes should reflect this (mobile view ***and*** desktop view).

There is no specific length requirement, but as a rough estimate your proposal should be about a page and a half in length (if you were to print it), excluding the wireframes.

Remember that this is a team effort. At the end of your proposal, fill in the section where you describe your individual team members' contributions for the proposal, and any plans for dividing work in the future (e.g., someone may have experience with graphic design or databases). The sum of effort contribution percentages across all team members should add to 100% for this milestone.

## Part 3: Screencast

Create a short (~5 min but no longer than 10 min; no minimum) screencast describing your project idea using your wireframes and descriptions from part 2 as visual support. This will essentially be an elevator pitch for your project idea. Make sure you mention each team member's individual contributions to the proposal (ideas, wireframes, etc.).

---

## Submission

You will submit Part 2 via your group GitHub repository in the `README.md` file inside the `Proposal` folder. This file should display your draft wireframes in an appropriate location within the writeup.

Your screencast will be submitted via Moodle.

Make sure you commit and push your changes before the deadline! You can verify you have done this by navigating to GitHub's web interface and inspecting the state of your repository there.
