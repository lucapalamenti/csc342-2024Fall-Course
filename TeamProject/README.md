# Group Project

You will work in **groups of at most 3** to develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that addresses a problem of interest of your choosing.

More details about the project, including guidelines for each milestone, will be provided as the semester progresses.

## Finding a Group

You will form teams on your own. To facilitate this process, we have created the `#matchmaking` text channel in the Class Discord server. Once you have formed a team, please record your group on Moodle.


## Progressive Web Applications

In short, Progressive Web Applications are modern web apps that provide a mobile-first app-like experience on modern browsers while still supporting older technologies (see [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)). PWA technologies allow the application to be installed on supporting platforms and behave as a regular application.

## Useful PWA Resources

Here are some resources to get you started:

* [PWA on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
* [Overview of Progressive Web Apps from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/)
* [Getting Started with PWAs from Google](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/getting-started-pwa/)

## Technical Constraints

At the minimum, your project must:

* Be mobile-first. Your UI should be responsive and behave like a native app when on mobile.
* Follow accessibility best practices
* Allow users to create accounts and ensure proper authentication
* Use a relational database
* Provide graceful offline functionality, splash screen, and other PWA capabilities
* Have significant, non-trivial implementation (not just a bunch of libraries and some glue)
* Serve a REST API
* Be hosted on Docker
* Be configurable
* Be installable

Consider going beyond the basics to implement more interesting use cases such as:

* Push notifications
* Offline data input (that is then synchronized when the user is back online)
