# Activity D05.a: Arrays to Objects

In this activity, you will practice iteration and object construction by converting arrays into objects.

## Activity Resources

1. [MDN: Array Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
2. Assets
   * [JavaScript Starter](files/arraysToObject.js)

## Task: Convert Arrays to Objects

You are given a JavaScript file with an array called `keys` that represent keys of objects you will have to create. There is also a `values` array that contains the data for each key in the same order. Your task is to convert these data into an array of objects where each object has all keys in `keys` and the values of each key comes from the `values` array.

### Steps

1. Create a new folder in your repository's Scratch Pad under today's folder for this activity.
2. Download the JavaScript starter file from the resources above and place it in the new folder.
3. Write code to create an array of objects. The expected output is shown in the comments of the starter file.
5. Run the script from a terminal using `$ node arraysToObject.js` and verify that the array of objects is printed to the console as exoected.

### Bonus

If you have time, experiment with different types of iteration.
